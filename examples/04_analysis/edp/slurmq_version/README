Please also refer to README in `local_version`.

The difference between this (`slurmq_version`) and `local_version` is that you can submit the first step
to SLURM by using "sbatch 1_edp.py" to parallelize the calculations for all trajectories at the same time.

In addition to the changes in the "## update system info ##" section, you also need to change the trajectory
indices in line "#SBATCH --array=101-105" (101 is the first trajectory and 105 is the last).
