There are two modes of the scd calculation:

1. Ignore the leaflet difference and calculate the averaged Scd's. This is good for symmetric bilayers.

2. Calculate Scd's for each leaflet separately.


For 1. The user only needs to update the "## update system info ##" section in `scd_leaflet_agnostic.py` and run the script
using python (with fflip and its dependencies installed). A folder named `scd_leaflet_agnostic` will be created and Scd's
will be reported for each carbon position individually. For carbon postions where a splitting is expected (such as C22 in
G-lipids), the order parameters for each deuterium will be reported separately.


For 2, there are two ways to tell the program how to identify lipids/atoms belonging to the upper or lower leaflet.
(1) In the example `leaflet_scd1.py`, a hard coded index (7233) is given by the user as the last atom index in the upper leaflet.
    This only works when all the atom indexes in one leaflet is smaller than all the atom indexes in the other leaflet (which is
    typical for structures prepared by CHARMM-GUI).
(2) In the example `leaflet_scd2.py`, a *crd file with membrane placed at the center of the box is given and the program will 
    figure out which atoms are from the upper/lower leaflet.
In both `leaflet_scd1.py` and `leaflet_scd2.py`, the user only needs to update the "## update system info ##" section and run
the script using python (with fflip and its dependencies installed). Two folders called `scd_up` and `scd_low` will be craeted
and the Scd's will be reported for each carbon postition individually for each leaflet. Carbons with splitting wil be reported
separately.
