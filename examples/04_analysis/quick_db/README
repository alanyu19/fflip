This script works very similarly to the EDP calculation.

1. First update the "## update system info ##" block.

2. Run the script using python.

3. The time series data will be reported as "db_?_?.dat", where the first number is the
first trajectory indice and the second number is the last trajectory indice.

4. The overall thickness (DB) can be obtained as the average of the time series.

In principle, you can submit many jobs at once to slurm and each job only needs to calculate
one particular trajectory or a trajectory range. 

There is an important parameter called "EDGE_BINS". This is needed because DB is calculated based on
the water density profile, which will drop to zero beyond the periodic box boundary (in z), and this
"EDGE_BINS" parameter controls the number of edge bins (each end of the box) to dispose before an
autodection code can be applied to identify the plateau of the water density profile. For DPPC and
lipids of similar length, EDGE_BINS=130 works fine. When it doesn't work, you will see totally
unreasonable numbers in the DB data and then you will need to test increasing/decreasing this number.
