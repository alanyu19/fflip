Please refer to https://user.eng.umd.edu/~jbklauda/wiki/doku.php?id=pairwise_2d-rdf_and_clustering
for a more detailed instruction (pay attention to small code changes, though).

In short, rdf's should be calculated first since the pairwise minimum energy distances based on the
rdf's can be used as parameters in clustering analysis.

I. To run the rdf calculation:
1) Update system info in `rdf/run.py`
2) Run `rdf/run.py` with python

II. To run the clustering calculation:
1) Update all blocks with keyword "UPDATE" in `clustering/1_calc.py` and run it using python
2) Update all blocks with keyword "UPDATE" in `clustering/2_visualize.py` and run it using python
Instructions for updating the parameters in `clustering/1_calc.py` are included as comments in that file.


You can parallalize the code yourself and submit using slurm as needed.
