Step1. Update system info in 1_edp.py and run it using python

It will automatically generate data per lipid type, per atom name, and per trajectory index. Data for upper
and lower leaflets will be stored separately. **No water/ion data will be generated!**


Step2. Update PSF_FILE in 2_combine.py and run it using python

This step will combine data from all trajectories and write the averaged atomic density and EDP for each
atom.


Note the program will try to recenter the trajectories first so that the membrane is at the center of the box.
This function is not fully tested and may not be suitable for the trajectories generated by the NAMD
code used in the Klauda lab. So be careful and examine the trajectories in the `recenter` folder when using
this code. I strongly encourage using rickflow (openmm in backend) for simulation since it is perfectly compatible
with the recentering algorithm in fflip. (See `fflip/examples/02_additive_lipid/simulation/iter0/dppc_bilayer_0_323.15`)
